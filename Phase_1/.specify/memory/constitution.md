# Todo CLI Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-Driven Development
All development must be driven by a finalized specification document. The specification is the single source of truth, and it must be updated and validated before any code is generated.

### II. Menu-Based CLI Interface
The application must exclusively use a menu-based command-line interface. The user will interact with the application by selecting numbered options from a displayed menu. No command-line arguments, flags, or other non-menu interactions are permitted.

### III. In-Memory Storage
The application must use in-memory data structures for all data storage. No data persistence to files, databases, or any other medium is allowed. All data will be lost when the application exits.

### IV. Technology Stack
The application must be written in Python 3.13 and must not use any external libraries. All necessary functionality must be implemented using Python's standard library.

## Governance
This constitution is the highest authority for the project. All specifications and code must adhere to these principles. Any deviation is considered a failure to meet the project requirements.
